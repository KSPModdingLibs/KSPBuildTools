# Github Actions

KSPBuildTools provides several composite actions for use with Github Actions and compatible platforms. These are smaller units of tasks that can be combined in workflows to help automate testing, building, and releasing mods.

For usage, see [Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/using-pre-written-building-blocks-in-your-workflow) in the
Github docs.
